§1. Land
	a. Location
		(i) A parcel of land suitable for a base of operations should be located in a sparsely-populated area.
		(ii) In order to ensure our privacy, conceal our operations, and maximize security, it is preferable to choose a location wherein the main structure may be built a minimum of 100 yards (92 meters) from the nearest neighbor's dwelling and/or 50 yards (46 meters) from the land's border.
		(iii) It is preferable to choose land that is within 5 to 10 miles (8 to 16 km), or within a reasonable bicycling or walking distance, of a town or commercial venu such as a shopping center, strip mall, or general store.  This will allow for easy accessibility of supplies (food, equipment, financial transactions, etc.) without necessitating motor vehicle use.
		(iv) Specialized cells should be located in areas conducive to their respective roles.  For example, agricultural cells should be based in an area with high-quality soil.
	b. Size and Dimensions
		(i) A parcel of land suitable for a base of operations should be as large as possible, to the extent that all operations are concealed, all structures are defensible, and there is ample space for operations and logistics thereof.
		(ii) A lot of one acre (4046 sq. meters) is a generous portion for a large-house-sized single structure.
		(iii) A perfectly square lot begets flexibility in placement of structures upon the land.  Irregular shapes such as long rectangles and trapezoids are generally not preferable, excepting when the space is satisfactory according to paragraph (i) and that the conditions set forth in §1a(ii) are met.
